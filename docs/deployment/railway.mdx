## Why Railway?

Railway provides a zero-ops PaaS experience with private networking and per-service logs that perfectly fits Bytebot’s multi-container architecture. The official template wires every service together using the latest container images pushed to the `edge` branch.

## What Gets Deployed

| Service          | Container Image (edge)                                               | Port | Exposed? | Purpose                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **bytebot-ui**   | `ghcr.io/bytebot-ai/bytebot-ui:edge`                                 | 9992 | **Yes**  | Next.js web UI rendered to the world |
| **bytebot-agent**| `ghcr.io/bytebot-ai/bytebot-agent:edge`                              | 9991 | No       | Task orchestration & LLM calls       |
| **bytebot-desktop**| `ghcr.io/bytebot-ai/bytebot-desktop:edge`                          | 9990 | No       | Containerised Ubuntu + XFCE desktop  |
| **postgres**     | `postgres:14-alpine`                                                 | 5432 | No       | Persistence layer                    |

All internal traffic flows through Railway’s [private networking](https://docs.railway.com/guides/private-networking). Only `bytebot-ui` is assigned a public domain.

## Step-by-Step Walk-through

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Open the Template">
    Click the **Deploy on Railway** button above or visit [https://railway.com/deploy/bytebot?referralCode=L9lKXQ](https://railway.com/deploy/bytebot?referralCode=L9lKXQ).
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Configure Environment">
    For the bytebot-agent resource, add your AI API key (choose at least one):
    - **Anthropic**: Paste into `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude models
    - **OpenAI**: Paste into `OPENAI_API_KEY` for GPT models
    - **Google**: Paste into `GEMINI_API_KEY` for Gemini models
    
    Keep other defaults as is.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Kick off the Deployment">
    Press **Deploy**. Railway will pull the pre-built images, create the Postgres database and link all services on a private network.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Launch Bytebot">
    When the build logs show *"bytebot-ui: ready"*, click the generated URL (e.g. `https://bytebot-ui-prod.up.railway.app`). You should see the task interface. Create a task and watch the desktop stream!  
    _Tip: You can tail logs for each service from the Railway dashboard._
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The first deploy downloads several container layers – expect ~2 minutes. Subsequent redeploys are much faster.
</Note>

## Private Networking & Security

• **Private networking** ensures that the agent, desktop and database can communicate securely without exposing their ports to the internet.  
• **Public exposure** is limited to the UI which serves static assets and proxies WebSocket traffic.  
• **Add authentication** by placing the UI behind Railway’s built-in password protection or an external provider (e.g. Cloudflare Access, Auth0, OAuth proxy).  
• You can also point a custom domain to the UI from the Railway dashboard and enable Cloudflare for WAF/CDN protection.

---

## Customisation & Scaling

1. **Change images** – Fork the repo, push your own images and edit the template’s `Dockerfile` references.  
2. **Increase resources** – Each service has an independent CPU/RAM slider in Railway. Bump up the desktop or agent if you plan heavy automations.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | ---- |
| Web UI shows “connecting…” | Desktop not ready or private networking mis-config | Wait for `bytebot-desktop` container to finish starting, or restart service |
| Agent errors `401` or `403` | Missing/invalid API key | Re-enter your AI provider's API key in Railway variables |
| Slow desktop video | Free Railway plan throttling | Upgrade plan or reduce screen resolution in desktop settings |
