## What is Bytebot?

Bytebot is an open-source AI agent that can control a computer desktop to complete tasks for you. It runs in Docker containers on your own infrastructure, giving you a virtual assistant that can:

- Use any desktop application (browser, email, office tools, etc.)
- Process uploaded files including PDFs, spreadsheets, and documents
- Read entire files directly into the LLM context for rapid analysis
- Automate repetitive tasks like data entry and form filling
- Handle complex workflows that span multiple applications
- Work 24/7 without human supervision

Simply describe what you need done in plain English, and Bytebot will figure out how to do it ‚Äì clicking buttons, typing text, navigating websites, reading documents, and completing tasks just like a human would.

## Why Bytebot Over Traditional RPA?

  <Card title="No Complex Scripting" icon="code-branch">
    Unlike UiPath or similar tools, no need to design flowcharts or write scripts - just describe tasks naturally
  </Card>
  <Card title="Adaptive Intelligence" icon="brain">
    AI-powered understanding means Bytebot adapts to UI changes without breaking
  </Card>
  <Card title="Visual Understanding" icon="eye">
    Can read and understand any interface, not just pre-mapped elements
  </Card>
  <Card title="Human-Like Problem Solving" icon="lightbulb">
    Handles unexpected popups, errors, and variations automatically
  </Card>

  <Card title="Complete Privacy" icon="shield">
    Your tasks and data never leave your infrastructure. Everything runs locally
    on your servers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Control" icon="sliders">
    Customize the desktop environment, install any applications, and configure
    to your exact needs.

  <Card title="No Usage Limits" icon="infinity">
    Use your own LLM API keys without platform restrictions or additional fees.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure Isolation" icon="lock">
    Each desktop runs in its own container, completely isolated from your host
    system.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Enterprise Automation (RPA Replacement)
Bytebot is the next generation of RPA (Robotic Process Automation). It handles the same complex workflows as traditional tools like UiPath, but with AI-powered adaptability and automatic authentication:

- **Financial Operations**: Automate banking portal access (including 2FA when password manager extensions are configured), download transaction files, and process them through multiple systems
- **Compliance Workflows**: Navigate government websites, download regulatory documents, extract data, and update compliance tracking systems
- **Multi-System Integration**: Bridge legacy systems that lack APIs by automating the UI interactions between them
- **Vendor Management**: Log into supplier portals, download invoices, reconcile with internal systems, and process payments

### Business Process Automation
- **Data Reconciliation**: Pull reports from multiple SaaS platforms, cross-reference data, and generate consolidated reports
- **Customer Onboarding**: Navigate between CRM, banking, and verification systems to complete new customer setup
- **Purchase Order Processing**: Extract POs from webmail portals, enter into ERP systems, and update inventory databases
- **HR Operations**: Collect employee data from various systems, update records, and ensure consistency across platforms

### Development & QA Integration
Bytebot becomes even more powerful when combined with coding agents:

- **Full-Stack Testing**: Use a coding agent to generate code, then have Bytebot visually test and validate the output
- **Automated Debugging**: Let Bytebot reproduce user-reported issues while a coding agent analyzes and fixes the code
- **End-to-End Development**: Code agents write features, Bytebot tests them, creating a complete development loop
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Automatically detect UI changes across deployments with screenshot comparisons

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe Your Task">
    Simply tell Bytebot what you want done in natural language through the tasks
    interface
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Plans the Actions">
    Bytebot understands your request and breaks it down into specific computer
    actions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Executes Actions">
    Bytebot executes the task on its virtual desktop using the keyboard
    and mouse
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch or Walk Away">
    Monitor it working in real-time through the task detail view, or let it
    complete tasks independently.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Results">
    Receive the completed task output, screenshots, or confirmation of
    completion
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture Overview

Bytebot consists of four integrated components working together:
