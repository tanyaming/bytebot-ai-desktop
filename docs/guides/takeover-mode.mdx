# Takeover Mode: Human-AI Collaboration

Takeover mode lets you take control of the desktop to help Bytebot when needed. There are two ways to use it:

## 1. During Task Execution
In the task detail view, you can hit the takeover button to:
- Interrupt the agent if it's going down the wrong path
- Guide it towards the correct solution
- Resolve issues when it's stumbling on something

## 2. Automatic Activation
Takeover mode is automatically enabled when a task status is set to "needs help" - this happens when the agent realizes it can't accomplish something on its own.

## How Actions Are Recorded
All your actions during takeover (clicks, drags, scrolls, typing, key presses) are automatically logged in the same unified action space that the agent uses. This means Bytebot understands and learns from everything you do.

## Desktop Tab for Setup

Outside of tasks, there's a dedicated **Desktop** tab on the main page that provides:
- Free-ranging access to the desktop
- Nothing is recorded in this mode
- Perfect for:
  - Installing programs
  - Logging into apps or websites
  - Setting up the desktop environment
  - General desktop maintenance

## Activating Takeover Mode

### Method 1: Manual Takeover During Tasks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Task Detail View">
    While Bytebot is working on a task, click on the task to open the detail view.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Takeover Button">
    Hit the takeover button to interrupt the agent and take control.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Guide Bytebot">
    Perform the necessary actions to get past the obstacle or show the correct path.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Release Control">
    Click to release control and let Bytebot continue from where you left off.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Automatic When Help Needed

When Bytebot sets a task status to "needs help":
- Takeover mode is automatically enabled
- You'll see a notification that Bytebot needs assistance
- Take control to help resolve the issue
- Bytebot will continue once you release control

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Complex UI Navigation

<Card title="Custom Applications" icon="window">
  **Scenario**: Working with proprietary or complex software
  
  **Steps**:
  1. Let Bytebot open the application
  2. Take control to navigate complex interfaces
  3. Use the chat to explain what you're doing
  4. Return control for Bytebot to continue
  
  **Example**: "Open our internal CRM, I'll show you how to navigate to the reports section"
</Card>

### 2. Error Recovery

<Card title="Handling Unexpected Situations" icon="exclamation-triangle">
  **Scenario**: Bytebot encounters an error or gets stuck
  
  **Steps**:
  1. Notice Bytebot is struggling
  2. Take control to resolve the issue
  3. Guide it past the problem
  4. Explain what went wrong in chat
  5. Return control to let Bytebot continue
  
  **Example**: "Let me handle this unexpected popup that's blocking the workflow"
</Card>

### 3. Teaching by Demonstration

<Card title="Show Don't Tell" icon="graduation-cap">
  **Scenario**: Complex multi-step processes
  
  **Steps**:
  1. Take control when you need to demonstrate
  2. Perform the task normally (no need to move slowly)
  3. Use chat to explain what you're clicking and why
  4. Return control
  5. Ask Bytebot to repeat the process
  
  **Example**: "Watch me navigate through our vendor portal to find the invoice section"
</Card>

<Warning>
  **Important**: Screenshots are taken for every action during takeover mode. Do not enter any data that you don't want captured in screenshots.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Use Chat While Taking Over**: Type messages explaining what you're doing and why
- **Explain Your Clicks**: Share context about UI elements and their purpose
- **Return Control Before Leaving**: Always release control before exiting the task detail view
- **Test Understanding**: Ask Bytebot to summarize what it learned

### Don'ts ❌

- **Enter Data You Don't Want Captured**: Screenshots are taken of all actions
- **Skip Chat Explanations**: Context helps Bytebot learn patterns
- **Leave Task View While in Control**: This will leave the task stuck in takeover mode
- **Assume Knowledge**: Explain application-specific workflows

<Note>
  **No Need to Move Slowly**: Bytebot captures the state before and after each action, so you can work at normal speed.
</Note>


## Summary

Takeover mode provides flexibility when you need to guide Bytebot or handle situations it can't manage alone. Whether you're navigating complex interfaces, recovering from errors, or teaching new workflows, takeover mode ensures you're always in control when needed.
