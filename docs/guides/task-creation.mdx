# Creating and Managing Tasks in Bytebot

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about creating tasks that Bytebot can execute effectively, and managing them through their lifecycle.

## Understanding Tasks

A task is any job you want Bytebot to complete. Tasks can be:

- **Simple**: "Log in to GitHub" or "Visit example.com" (uses one program)
- **Complex**: "Download invoices from email and save them to a folder" (uses multiple programs)
- **File-based**: "Read the uploaded PDF and extract all email addresses" (processes uploaded files)
- **Collaborative**: "Process invoices, ask me to handle special approvals"

## Working with Files

Bytebot has powerful file handling capabilities that make it perfect for document processing and data analysis tasks.

### Uploading Files with Tasks

When creating a task, you can upload files that will be automatically saved to the desktop instance. This is incredibly useful for:

- **Document Processing**: Upload PDFs, spreadsheets, or documents for Bytebot to analyze
- **Data Analysis**: Provide CSV files or datasets for processing
- **Template Filling**: Upload forms or templates that need to be completed
- **Batch Operations**: Upload multiple files for bulk processing

<Note>
  **Game Changer**: Bytebot can read entire files, including PDFs, directly into the LLM context. This means it can process large amounts of data quickly and understand complex documents without manual extraction.
</Note>

### File Upload Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web UI">
    1. Click the attachment button when creating a task
    2. Select files to upload (PDFs, CSVs, images, etc.)
    3. Files are automatically saved to the desktop
    4. Reference them in your task description:
    ```
    "Read the uploaded contracts.pdf and extract all payment terms, 
    then create a summary spreadsheet with vendor names and terms"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
    ```bash
    # Upload files with task creation (multipart/form-data)
    curl -X POST http://localhost:9991/tasks \
      -F "description=Analyze the uploaded financial statements and create a summary" \
      -F "priority=HIGH" \
      -F "files=@financial_statements_2024.pdf" \
      -F "files=@budget_comparison.xlsx"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing Active Tasks

### Task States

<img src="/images/task-lifecycle.png" alt="Task Lifecycle" className="w-full max-w-3xl" />

Tasks move through these states:

1. **Created** ‚Üí Task is defined but not started
2. **Queued** ‚Üí Waiting for agent availability
3. **Running** ‚Üí Actively being worked on
4. **Needs Help** ‚Üí Requires human input
5. **Completed** ‚Üí Successfully finished
6. **Failed** ‚Üí Could not be completed

### Monitoring Progress

#### Real-time Updates

Watch Bytebot work through the task detail viewer:

- **Green dot**: Task is actively running
- **Status messages**: Current step being executed
- **Desktop view**: See what Bytebot sees in real-time

#### Chat Messages

Bytebot provides updates like:
```
Assistant: I'm now searching for project management tools...
Assistant: Found 15 options, filtering by your criteria...
Assistant: Creating the comparison table with 5 tools...
```

### Interacting with Running Tasks

#### Providing Additional Information

```
User: "Also include free tier options in your research"
Assistant: "I'll add a column for free tier availability to the comparison table."
```

#### Clarifying Instructions

```
Assistant: "I found multiple forms on this page. Which one should I fill out?"
User: "Use the 'Contact Sales' form on the right side"
```

#### Modifying Tasks

```
User: "Actually, make it top 10 tools instead of top 5"
Assistant: "I'll expand my research to include 10 tools in the comparison."
```

## Advanced Task Management

### Task Dependencies

Chain tasks that depend on each other:

```
Task 1: "Download the invoice from the vendor portal"
Task 2: "Open the downloaded invoice and extract the total amount"
Task 3: "Enter the amount into our accounting system"
```

## Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ

1. **Start Simple**: Test with basic tasks before complex ones
2. **Provide Examples**: "Format it like the report from last week"
3. **Include Credentials Safely**: Use takeover mode for passwords
4. **Set Realistic Expectations**: Complex tasks take time
5. **Review Results**: Always verify important outputs

### Don'ts ‚ùå

1. **Overload Single Tasks**: Break complex workflows into steps
2. **Assume Knowledge**: Explain custom applications
3. **Skip Context**: Always provide necessary background
4. **Ignore Errors**: Address issues promptly
5. **Rush Critical Tasks**: Allow time for careful execution
